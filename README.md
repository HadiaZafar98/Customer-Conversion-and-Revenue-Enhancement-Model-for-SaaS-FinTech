# User Engagement & Revenue Enhancement Model for SaaS FinTech

## Executive Summary
Leveraging SQL, Python, and Power BI, I conducted an in-depth analysis of user behavior within the order funnel. The analysis pinpointed two critical areas for potential revenue growth: increasing user engagement rates and boosting the rate of successful login attempts. Recommended actions to enhance conversion include:

- **Optimize workflow messaging**
- **Implement proactive reminders**
- **Strengthen client support initiatives**

## Business Problem
The primary business challenge was to address a lower-than-anticipated conversion rate in the SaaS FinTech product. The goal was to identify stages in the funnel where users were disengaging and propose strategies to improve the completion of orders, thereby enhancing revenue.

## Methodology
1. **Data Extraction & Preparation**:
   - Employed SQL for comprehensive data extraction, cleansing, and transformation.

2. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Developed a Power BI dashboard to monitor order progression across different stages.

3. **Funnel Analysis & Simulation**:
   - Utilized Python for detailed funnel analysis and simulation to assess the impact of various changes on conversion rates and revenue.

## Skills Utilized
- **SQL**: Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Joins, Conditional Statements
- **Power BI**: DAX, Data Modeling, Visualizations
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Statistical Modeling

## Results & Business Recommendations
The developed dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into funnel metrics, enabling product and sales teams to make data-driven decisions. Key findings include a significant drop-off before user interaction and a lower-than-expected rate of successful login completions. The analysis revealed:

- Increasing the user interaction rate by 1% could yield an additional $285 in daily revenue.
- A 1% increase in successful login completions could result in an additional $405 in daily revenue.

### Recommendations:
- Send automated reminders to users who have not completed their login.
- Work closely with clients to provide better guidance and support to their users.
- Include a progress indicator and reassuring messages to encourage users to complete the process.

## Next Steps
1. **A/B Testing**: Test the effectiveness of new workflow copy and reminder messages.
2. **Client Training**: Equip clients with the necessary tools and knowledge to assist users.
3. **Tracking & Analytics**: Monitor the performance of email and text message campaigns.
